## 💡 What I’m Building & Deploying

- **Codemia (Founder)**
  AI-powered learning platform for code onboarding and review. Built using OpenAI, Pinecone, and Docker; deployed to early users (250+), with live vector search and real-time code feedback.

- **Clinical AI Agent – LangChain + RAG**
  Built a biomedical QA agent using LangChain and HuggingFace models with an embedded retrieval pipeline. Achieved 88% EM accuracy and adopted by 3 clinical teams after live demo.

- **Churn Prediction System – Client-Facing ML**
  Delivered a Python-based churn pipeline that surfaces at-risk users using behavioral patterns. Secured a 2-week customer pilot and integrated feedback loops into the model iteration process.

- **ZoomInfo GTM Analytics Pipelines**
  Built Snowflake + Python-based modular pipelines for 310M+ firmographic records and 150M+ contact points. Supported 6+ GTM teams with real-time dashboards and ML signals, driving $1M+ in revenue.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I once built a mini AI tutor for my non-tech friends to learn Python — they mostly used it to write breakup texts. Real-world usage counts, right? 😄
