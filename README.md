## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in building **real-time AI systems** and **LLM-powered tools** that solve complex business problems. With an **MS in Business Analytics** from UC Davis, I combine technical depth in ML engineering with a sharp focus on business value and customer deployment.

- **Focus**: Turning AI research into deployed, customer-facing products.
- **Core Stack**: Python, LangChain, RAG, Spark, SQL, Docker.
- **Passion**: Fast prototyping, ML observability, and robust system design.

## 💡 What I'm Building

### �️ **Hearing Uncertainty**
> **Unsupervised Discovery of Hesitation in Speech**
- **Raw speech → self-supervised audio embeddings.**
- No labels; structure discovered via clustering and anomaly scoring.
- Human-in-the-loop interpretation of uncertainty patterns.
- Built for real-world voice interactions.

### 👁️ **Seeing Confusion**
> **Detecting Visual Hesitation Without Labels**
- **Short video frames analyzed using pretrained vision encoders.**
- Unsupervised discovery of hesitation cues (pauses, gaze, motion).
- PCA-based visualization for interpretability.
- Designed for noisy, unlabeled visual data.

### 🧠 **Multimodal Signals of Uncertainty**
> **Combined Audio and Vision for Human Interaction**
- **Combines audio and vision embeddings into a shared space.**
- Surfaces moments of hesitation without explicit supervision.
- Focuses on representation learning over classification.
- Practical pipeline for real-time systems.

### � **From Raw Signals to Insight**
> **Unsupervised ML for Human Uncertainty**
- **Engineering-first approach with research intuition.**
- Audio and vision processed as raw signals.
- Pretrained encoders used as frozen feature extractors.
- Anomaly detection highlights atypical behavior.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I once built a mini AI tutor for my non-tech friends to learn Python.
*Result:* They mostly used it to generate breakup texts. Real-world usage is real-world usage, right? 😄
