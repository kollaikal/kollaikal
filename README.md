# 👋 Hi there, I'm Kollaikal Rupesh!

I'm an **AI Engineer** and **Technical Product Builder** currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics (MSBA) at UC Davis. I specialize in building real-time AI systems, LLM-powered tools, and data-driven products that solve high-impact problems across domains.

With experience across **LLMs, RAG pipelines, ML infra, and backend APIs**, I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI engineering and product strategy** — shipping scalable tools that make a difference.

### 💡 What I’m Building

-  **PubMed Summarization AI Agent**: Containerized pipeline (no APIs) using Transformers + Dagger for fully local document summarization  
-  **SEC Filing Summarizer**: LLM tool to extract insights from financial documents using GPT + FastAPI  
-  **Fraud Detection Engine**: Transformer-embedded anomaly detection model with 91.8% precision  
-  **Codemia**: AI-powered learning platform for code review and onboarding, built with OpenAI, Pinecone, and Docker — used by 250+ learners

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I once tried to build a mini AI tutor to teach my non-tech friends Python… they asked it to write breakup texts instead. Still counts as “real-world usage,” right?
